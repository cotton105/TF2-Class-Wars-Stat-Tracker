# Team Fortress 2 Class Wars Tracker
## Overview
This app is designed for use on Delfy's Fun Server on TF2.
Connect to the server with the following console command:\
`connect 31.186.251.170:27015`

The server uses multiple plugins, including Class Warfare
and Roll The Dice. This app was made to keep track of the
historical stats of all the class match-ups, according to
the game mode. It began as a crude Excel worksheet, but I
decided that I wanted to develop an app to do it rather
than load a clunky Excel file every time.
