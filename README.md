# Team Fortress 2 Class Wars Tracker
## Overview
This app is designed for use on Delfy's Fun Server on TF2.
Connect to the server here:
[connect](steam://connect/31.186.251.170:27015)\
Alternatively, enter `connect 31.186.251.170:27015` in the
TF2 console.

The server uses multiple plugins, including Class Warfare
and Roll The Dice. This app was made to keep track of the
historical stats of all the class match-ups, according to
the game mode. It began as a crude Excel worksheet, but I
decided that I wanted to develop an app to do it rather
than load a clunky Excel file every time.
